/* Reason for time complexity not coming N!
In the N-Queens problem, you're trying to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. 
The number of different ways you can arrange these queens grows very quickly as the size of the board (N) increases.

For N=5, there are indeed 120 different ways to place the queens (expressed as 5!). 
But not all arrangements need to be explored to find a solution. 
The algorithm you're using employs a technique called backtracking. 
It systematically explores different combinations of queen placements but "backtracks" when it realizes that a certain arrangement cannot lead to a solution.

In N=5 case, the algorithm explored 43 different combinations before finding a solution. 
These 43 combinations represent the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm for this specific scenario. 
The reason it's less than 120 is due to backtracking - the algorithm doesn't blindly try all possible combinations 
but prunes the search space intelligently based on the constraints of the problem.

If you were to try N=8, the total number of possible combinations would be 8! = 40,320. 
The algorithm would still make far fewer than 40,320 recursive calls due to backtracking, 
but it would be significantly more than the 43 calls made for N=5.

So, in summary, the number of recursive calls (43 for N=5) represents the specific path the algorithm took through the search space, 
but the total number of possible combinations (N!) illustrates the vastness of the problem space.
